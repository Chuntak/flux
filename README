and follow its instructions.

To run simply load in the logic by typing on swi-prolog console:
    ?- [run].
    true.
    ?- loadProgram.
    true.

It uses the pre-defined predicate findall and length, if for some reason it throws and error,
you'll have to import it yourself.

A sample input is provided below:

    ?- grid(4,4).
    true.
    ?- robot(0,0).
    true.
    ?- person(2,0).
    true.

These will load in the facts.

To start the robot type in:
main.

The output will be the actions the robots taken, and for every state that
the robot moves, it will print its current state.

There are some bugs in the AI, because of the time constraint, I do not have the time to finish debugging.
